| [HIPAA regulations: a new era of medical-record privacy](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMlim035027) | Annas, George J       | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) introduced new privacy regulations that came into effect on April 14, 2003. This article discusses the implications of these regulations for practicing physicians. The regulations apply to all health care providers engaged in electronic business transactions, including billing. As a result, virtually every physician is affected. The regulations mandate that health care providers supply patients with a privacy notice detailing who can access their records without explicit consent and outlining patients' rights to inspect and amend their own records.       |
| [The eu general data protection regulation (gdpr)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3152676)               | Voigt, Paul and Von dem Bussche, Axel      | This book offers expert guidance on the practical implementation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and systematically analyzes its various provisions. It features examples, tables, a checklist, and other resources to demonstrate the practical implications of the new legislation. The handbook covers the GDPR's scope of application, organizational and material requirements for data protection, data subjects' rights, the role of supervisory authorities, enforcement and fines, national particularities, and a brief outlook on the legal consequences for key data processing areas such as Cloud Computing, Big Data, and the Internet of Things. The GDPR, adopted in 2016 and effective from May 2018, introduces numerous new and intensified data protection obligations and significantly increases fines (up to 20 million euros). Owing to the GDPR's broad, transnational scope of application, it impacts not only companies within the European Union but also numerous companies worldwide.       |
| [Privacy-preserving generative deep neural networks support clinical data sharing]()                         | Beaulieu-Jones, Brett K and Yuan, William and Finlayson, Samuel G and Wu, Zhiyong and Avillach, Paul and Kohane, Isaac S      | Data sharing plays a crucial role in advancing scientific progress, but sharing individual-level data while maintaining patient privacy poses challenges. In this study, pairs of deep neural networks were used to generate simulated, synthetic participants closely resembling the participants of the SPRINT trial (Systolic Blood Pressure Trial). The researchers demonstrated that such paired networks could be trained with differential privacy, a formal privacy framework that minimizes the likelihood of identifying a real participant in the trial through queries of the synthetic participants' data. Machine learning predictors developed on the synthetic population were found to generalize to the original dataset. This suggests that the synthetic data can be shared with others, enabling them to conduct hypothesis-generating analyses as if they had access to the original trial data. The use of deep neural networks to generate synthetic participants can facilitate secondary analyses and reproducible investigation of clinical datasets by improving data sharing while preserving participant privacy.       |
